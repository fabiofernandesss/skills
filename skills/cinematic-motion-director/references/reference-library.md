# Reference Library

Where the rules in this skill come from, and what each source contributes. Use references
to extract **principles** — composition, rhythm, materiality, movement — never to copy a
frame, a style frame or a studio's signature move.

| **BUCK** — Comfy Brand Refresh ✓ https://www.buck.co/work/comfy-brand-refresh · portfolio ✓ https://www.buck.co/work | Motion as a *system*: type, 3D objects, lines and shapes share one logic, so any new piece looks related. → `Direction` object, shape vocabulary, transition grammar in `art-direction.md`. |
| **Ordinary Folk** ✓ https://www.ordinaryfolk.co/work | Turning abstract ideas into concrete visual metaphors; rhythm and composition at the service of narrative; transitions that carry meaning. → "visual metaphor" step, match cuts, intensity curve. |
| **Motionographer** ✓ https://motionographer.com/ | Contemporary repertoire: discovering studios, styles and directions. → use to widen options during the Concept step, not to pick a style to clone. |
| **Art of the Title** ✓ https://www.artofthetitle.com/ | Title sequence craft (Saul Bass lineage onward): typography as the protagonist, graphic match cuts, economy of means. → kinetic typography and match-cut rules. |

## Prompt repertoire

| Source | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| awesome-opus5-5-videos ✓ https://github.com/yihui-dev/awesome-opus5-5-videos (MIT list; the videos belong to their authors) | Analysed 2026-10-16: 703 entries (369 motion, 117 3D, 116 explainer, 101 interactive); 207 partial; median complete prompt = 35 words; 79 distinct prompts ≥ 100 words were read in full and distilled into `scene-recipes.md` (recipes, field numbers, default prohibitions, gotchas — credited by slug). Strongest briefs: twoclipping-000267, twoclipping-496100, flxrnc-251921, everestchris6-399895 (critic loop), brainextends-606193, gdgtify-989608. Earlier analysis: code-animation videos with the prompts behind them (`data/videos.json`, `prompts/*.md`). Lesson: one-line prompts give generic showreels; the strong ones are *director prompts* — real inputs, a direction paragraph, a prohibition list, a timeline with exact on-screen text and a stills check before delivery. → `templates/director-brief.md`. Use the prompts as structure references, with credit; never reuse other people's brands or footage. Many entries are partial (`prompt_partial: true`) — skip those. |
| Remotion TikTok template ✓ https://github.com/remotion-dev/template-tiktok | Whisper.cpp transcription + TikTok-style captions. → `talking-head-captions.md`. |
| HyperFrames ✓ https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes (Apache-2.0) | Alternative engine: write HTML, render video, built for agents. Consider when a project is HTML-first; this skill's direction and review rules apply unchanged. |

## How to use this library during a project

1. In the Concept step, browse 2–3 sources relevant to the brief's tone.
2. Write down *principles* you want ("type as protagonist", "everything snaps to a grid",
   "a single warm accent cutting through dark"), not frames.
3. Combine them with the project's own metaphor. If the result could be mistaken for a
   specific studio's piece, push it further away.
